# FlameRunnersETGMOD
A WIP mod for Enter the Gungeon.   
Hello! 
This is a small mod that I am making to add more items to ETG as well as new references to popular video games.  Think of it like an homage to some great cult classics that never made it into ETG.
If you have any ideas please let me know! I am always looking for some new things to add.
This was started using Kyle The Scientists example mod and video, so please understand that I am just building off of the template he made!  Go check him out, he does some cool ETG modding.
Finally this mod is open to everyone.  You may pull and use it whenever you want, just be sure to check back for any updates!

Enjoy!
